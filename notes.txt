2.Express query parameters
- "req.query"

3.Before using ejs
- app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
- we have to make a directory called "views"
- Use most of the logic inside the route and pass it to the ejs template.
4.Working with static files
- express.static(root,[options]) is a middleware
- app.use(express.static('public'))
5.ejs partials are important to duplicate stuff
-I would like to gather common code inside partials.
-Type "%- include('partials/your_ejs_file')%>" to include common code in your ejs.Â
