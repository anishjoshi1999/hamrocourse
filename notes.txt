1.parsing the request body
- req.body
- By default, it is undefined.
- To get values, you have to use body parser middleware.
- you have to install a package called bodyParser
parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}))
parse application/json
- app.use(bodyParser.json())
